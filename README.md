# grc-risk-management-portfolio
## Overview
This repository contains a simulated cybersecurity and enterprise risk management
case study completed as part of academic coursework. The project uses a fictional
organization, Business Supplies, Inc. (BSI), to demonstrate core Governance, Risk,
and Compliance (GRC) concepts.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to practice identifying information assets, assessing
threats, analyzing risk, and applying recognized frameworks in a structured way.
All work is based on documented assumptions and does not involve live systems.

## Scope of Work
- Identification and prioritization of key information assets
- Threat identification and prioritization
- Qualitative risk analysis
- Application of NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- Security policy gap analysis using NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Third-party vendor risk assessment
- Written explanations documenting methodology and decisions

## Methodology
The project uses qualitative scoring methods (CIA, likelihood, impact) and aligns
risk activities with NIST RMF and NIST CSF guidance. All findings are based on
hypothetical data and academic scenarios.

## Limitations
- No access to real or production environments
- No technical control implementation
- All artifacts are for educational purposes only

## Audience
This repository is intended for academic review, portfolio demonstration, and
entry-level GRC or risk management discussions.
